
**Task Management Program Flow (Laid-Back Version):**

1. **Get Ready:** We're all set to manage our tasks! We have a special file where we'll keep our tasks, called `tasks.json`.

2. **Load Tasks:** When we start the program, we look at `tasks.json` to see if there are any tasks we saved from previous sessions. If we find some, we load them up.

3. **Main Menu:** We present you with a menu to choose what you want to do:
   - If you pick "Add Task," we ask you for the title and description of your new task, make a record of it, and say, "Task added!"
   - If you choose "View Tasks," we show you all the tasks you have, telling you if they're completed or not.
   - If you select "Mark Task as Completed," you can let us know when you've finished a task, and we'll make a note of it.
   - If you say "Delete Task," we'll help you remove a task you no longer need.
   - And if you're ready to go, you can pick "Exit."

4. **Handle Choices:** Based on your choice, we do what you asked:
   - If you added a task, we remember it.
   - If you want to see your tasks, we show them to you.
   - If you marked a task as done, we remember that too.
   - If you want to delete a task, we'll help you with that.
   - And if you're done with us, we'll save all your tasks back to `tasks.json` and say goodbye.

5. **Repeat or Exit:** We keep showing you the menu until you say you want to exit. When you're ready to leave, we save everything and close up shop.

And that's it! You can use this simple program to manage your tasks, adding, viewing, completing, and deleting them as you please.
