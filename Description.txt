**Program Description:**

This program helps you keep track of your tasks. It works like a digital to-do list.

- **Adding Tasks:** You can add tasks by giving them a title and a description. It's like writing down what you need to do.

- **Viewing Tasks:** The program shows you all your tasks, so you can see what's on your list.

- **Marking Tasks Done:** When you finish a task, you can tell the program it's done, and it will remember that for you.

- **Deleting Tasks:** If you decide you don't need a task anymore, you can delete it from your list.

- **Saving Your List:** The program saves your tasks, so you don't lose them when you close it. It keeps them in a special file called `tasks.json`.

- **Menu Choices:** You'll see a menu with options like "Add Task," "View Tasks," and so on. You pick what you want to do by choosing from this menu.

- **Easy to Use:** It's easy to use, and you can do all this from your computer's command line.

- **Persistent:** Your tasks will be there even if you close the program and open it again later.

That's it! It's like having a digital notepad to manage your tasks and stay organized.
